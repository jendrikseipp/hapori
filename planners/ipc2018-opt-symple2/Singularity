Name        Symple-2
Description Symple performs a bidirectional A* search based on Edge-Valued Multi-Valued Decision Diagrams (EVMDDs). Symple-2 differs from Symple-1 only in the translation step. Symple-2 uses a symmetry reduction procedure to detect operations that are duplicates.  For example, in the researchers domain, the researchers are ordered in such a way that only one action is created instead of several identical ones for the publish-5 action.
